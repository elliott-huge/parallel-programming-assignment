Filepaths are relative, but will of course depend on where the program is ran from.

Consequently, the dataset folder have been included in the submission in two locations:

one under x64 folder if running from the .exe

another in the main submission folder if running from the .sln

The majority of productive code is within AssignmentFunctions.h, my_kernels.cl, and Tutorial 3.cpp (the Tutorial sln was used as the foundation for this submission).

experiments.cpp is simply storing my deprecated code as comments.


The program takes no commands save for the commandline arguments provided from the original tutorial.
